# 🎙️ AI-Driven Speaker Identification and Captioning

A Python-based AI project that identifies multiple speakers from an audio file and generates speaker-wise captions using Speaker Diarization and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR).

---

## 📋 Project Description

This project demonstrates how artificial intelligence techniques can be used to analyze audio conversations. It integrates **Speaker Diarization** and **Speech-to-Text (ASR)** to generate meaningful captions with speaker identification.

### Key Features:

* 🔹 **Speaker Identification:** Detects different speakers in audio
* 🔹 **Speaker Diarization:** Segments audio into speaker-wise parts
* 🔹 **Automatic Speech Recognition:** Converts speech into text
* 🔹 **Caption Generation:** Produces speaker-wise captions
* 🔹 **Modular Design:** Separate files for each functionality
* 🔹 **Simple & Lightweight:** Beginner-friendly implementation

## ⚙️ System Workflow

1. Audio file is provided as input
2. Speaker diarization divides audio into segments
3. Each segment is passed to ASR
4. Text is generated for each speaker
5. Final output shows speaker-wise captions

## 🎯 Sample Output

```
AI-Driven Speaker Identification and Captioning

Speaker 1: Good morning everyone.
Speaker 2: Today we will discuss our project.
Speaker 1: Thank you for listening.
```
